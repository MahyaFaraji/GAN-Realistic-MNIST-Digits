# GAN_Realistic-MNIST-digits

"Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, are a deep-learning-based generative model. 
GANs are a clever way of training a generative model by framing the problem as supervised learning with two sub-models: the generator model that we train to generate new examples, and the discriminator model that tries to classify examples as either real (from your dataset) or fake (generated)."

This project tries to generate fake but realistic version of the famous handwritten digits of MNIST. And the result, after 40K epochs (I know it's A LOT),
is not that bad !
